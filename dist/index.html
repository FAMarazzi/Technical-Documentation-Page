      Introduction
      </header>
      <p>
        Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.</li>
        <li>For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. The Python Language Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are also several books covering Python in depth.</li>

      Python Interpreter

      <p>
        The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support the GNU Readline library. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing Control-P to the first Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if ^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that file.
      </p>
      <p>By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.</p>

        Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).
      </p>
      <div class="code">
      <code>print("This line will be printed.")</code>

      First Steps Towards Programming
      </header>
      <p>
        Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
      </p>
      <div class="code"><code># Fibonacci series:<br>
      # the sum of two elements defines the next<br>
      a, b = 0, 1<br><br>
while a < 10:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print(a)<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a, b = b, a+b</code></div>
  </section>
  <section id="For_Statements" class="main-section">
    <header>
      for Statements
      </header>
      <p>
        The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):
      </p>
      <div class="code"><code># Measure some strings:<br>
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']<br>
for w in words:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print(w, len(w))</code></div>
      <p>Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:</p>
      <div class="code"><code># Create a sample collection<br>
users = {'Hans': 'active', 'Éléonore': 'inactive', '景太郎': 'active'}<br><br>

# Strategy:  Iterate over a copy<br>
for user, status in users.copy().items():<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;if status == 'inactive':<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;del users[user]<br>

# Strategy:  Create a new collection<br>
active_users = {}<br>
for user, status in users.items():<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;if status == 'active':<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;active_users[user] = status</code></div>

  </section>
  <section id="Defining_Functions" class="main-section">
    <header>
      Defining Functions
      </header>
      <p>
        We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary:
      <div class="code"><code>def fib(n):&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;# write Fibonacci series up to n<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;"""Print a Fibonacci series up to n."""<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a, b = 0, 1<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;while a < n:<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print(a, end=' ')<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a, b = b, a+b<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print()<br>

# Now call the function we just defined:<br>
fib(2000)
</code></div>
      <p>Coming from other languages, you might object that fib is not a function but a procedure since it doesn’t return a value. In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called None (it’s a built-in name). Writing the value None is normally suppressed by the interpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want to using print():</p>
      <div class="code"><code>fib(0)</code>
<code>print(fib(0))</code></div>
      </section>
      <section id="The_Range()_Function" class="main-section">
    <header>
      The range() Function
      </header>
      <p>
        If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. It generates arithmetic progressions:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
      <code>for i in range(5):<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;print(i)</code>
    </div>
      <p>The given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’)</p>
      </section>
      <section id="Pass_Statements" class="main-section">
    <header>
      pass Statements
      </header>
      <p>
        The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action. For example:
      </p>
      <div class="code"><code>while True:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)</code></div>
      <p>This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:</p>
      <div class="code"><code>class MyEmptyClass:<br>
    pass</code>
    </div>
      <p>Another place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when you are working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The pass is silently ignored:</p>
      <div class="code"><code>def initlog(*args):<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;pass   # Remember to implement this!</code></div>
  </section>
  <section id="Match_Statements" class="main-section">
    <header>
      match Statements
      </header>
      <p>A match statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive patterns given as one or more case blocks. This is superficially similar to a switch statement in C, Java or JavaScript (and many other languages), but it’s more similar to pattern matching in languages like Rust or Haskell. Only the first pattern that matches gets executed and it can also extract components (sequence elements or object attributes) from the value into variables.</p><p>The simplest form compares a subject value against one or more literals:<p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>def http_error(status):<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;match status:<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;case 400:<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            return "Bad request"<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;case 404:<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            return "Not found"<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;case 418:<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            return "I'm a teapot"<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;case _:<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            return "Something's wrong with the internet"</code>
          </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>and object</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform</p>
  </section>
  <section id="If_Statements" class="main-section">
    <header>if Statements</header>
      <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:</p>
      <div class="code"><code><span>x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))</span><br>

<span>if x < 0:</span><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span>x = 0</span><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span>print('Negative changed to zero')</span><br>
<span>elif x == 0:</span><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span>print('Zero')</span><br>
<span>elif x == 1:</span><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span>print('Single')</span><br>
<span>else:</span><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span>print('More')</span>
</code></div>
      <p>There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.
</p>
<p>If you’re comparing the same value to several constants, or checking for specific types or attributes, you may also find the match statement useful. For more details see match Statements.
